**mm-kadam/mm-kadam** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ğŸ”¬  Iâ€™m a Bioinformatics Scientist with experience in genomics, metagenomics, and computational biology. I specialize in building Nextflow/Docker/Conda pipelines for microbial genomics, AMR detection, and variant analysis, and I enjoy turning raw sequencing data into clear biological insights.

ğŸ’¬  Key highlights:

1. Developed reproducible pipelines for metagenomics, Klebsiella analysis, and SNP detection.
2. Skilled with SPAdes, Kraken, FastANI, Kleborate, RAxML, BCFtools, and more.
3. Published in Nature Communications Biology and Vaccines.
4. Experienced in R, Python, and R Shiny for data analysis & visualization.
