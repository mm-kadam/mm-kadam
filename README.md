## Hi, I'm Mahika Kadam 👋

🔬  I’m a Bioinformatics Scientist with experience in genomics, metagenomics, and computational biology. I specialize in building Nextflow/Docker/Conda pipelines for microbial genomics, AMR detection, and variant analysis, and I enjoy turning raw sequencing data into clear biological insights.

💬  Key highlights:

1. Designed and deployed reproducible bioinformatics pipelines for metagenomics, SNP detection, and microbial genome analysis.
2. Conducted AMR and mutation profiling to support infectious disease research and public health investigations.
3. Delivered training programs that introduced scientists to sequencing QC, genome assembly, and downstream analyses.
4. Co-authored peer-reviewed publications in computational biology and vaccine research.
5. Experienced in translating complex sequencing data into clear, actionable insights for research and healthcare.

🛠️ Languages & Tools

Programming: Python, SQL, R, Groovy, MATLAB
Workflow management: Nextflow, Docker, Conda
Genomics Tools: SPAdes, Kraken2, FastANI, Kleborate, RAxML, BCFtools, VCFtools, AMRFinder
Visualization: R Shiny, ggplot2, IGV

🌱 I’m passionate about creating scalable, accessible bioinformatics tools and applying them to solve challenges in infectious disease and precision medicine.

✨ Fun fact about me
When I’m not working with genomes, you’ll usually find me travelling to new cities, hiking in national parks, or trying out local food spots (I’m a big foodie 🍜🍕). And if I’m not out exploring or eating, I’m probably curled up binge-watching a gossipy drama or something sci-fi like Stranger Things.
