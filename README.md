## Hi, I'm Mahika Kadam 👋

🔬  I’m a Bioinformatics Scientist with experience in genomics, metagenomics, and computational biology. I specialize in building Nextflow/Docker/Conda pipelines for microbial genomics, AMR detection, and variant analysis, and I enjoy turning raw sequencing data into clear biological insights.

💬  Key highlights:

1. Developed reproducible pipelines for metagenomics, Klebsiella analysis, and SNP detection.
2. Skilled with SPAdes, Kraken, FastANI, Kleborate, RAxML, BCFtools, and more.
3. Published in Nature Communications Biology and Vaccines.
4. Experienced in R, Python, and R Shiny for data analysis & visualization.

🌱 I’m passionate about creating scalable, accessible bioinformatics tools and applying them to solve challenges in infectious disease and precision medicine.

✨ Fun fact about me
When I’m not working with genomes, you’ll usually find me travelling to new cities, hiking in national parks, or trying out local food spots (I’m a big foodie 🍜🍕). And if I’m not out exploring or eating, I’m probably curled up binge-watching a gossipy drama or something sci-fi like Stranger Things.
